# 🤖 Google AI Agents Intensive — 5-Day Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository for the **Google AI Agents Intensive Course** — a 5-day hands-on program exploring the next generation of intelligent, autonomous AI systems.  

This repo documents my learning, experiments, and mini-projects for each day of the course, from foundational agent concepts to deployment-ready prototypes.

## 📅 Course Overview

| Day | Topic | Summary |
|-----|--------|----------|
| **Day 1** | 🧩 *Introduction to Agents* | Learned the core concepts of AI agents — what makes them autonomous, how they differ from traditional LLMs, and their role in modern AI ecosystems. |
| **Day 2** | 🔧 *Agent Tools & Interoperability (MCP)* | Explored how agents use external tools and APIs to take action, and how the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** enables seamless tool discovery and usage. |
| **Day 3** | 🧠 *Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory* | Built agents that remember — implemented both short-term and long-term memory to enable contextual reasoning across multiple interactions. |
| **Day 4** | 📊 *Agent Quality & Evaluation* | Focused on reliability and observability — learned about logging, tracing, and metrics to evaluate and optimize agent performance. |
| **Day 5** | 🚀 *Prototype to Production* | Deployed my agent prototype to production and experimented with multi-agent communication using the **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol**. |
